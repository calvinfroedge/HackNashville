		<h2>Build Cool Stuff</h2>
		<p>The Nashville Hackathon won't be about business, or social media, or anything else like that.  It will be about building things - and people who can build things will be the ones who attend.</p>

		<h2>Eat and Drink Well</h2>
		<p>For the duration of the event, you'll have good food and drink.  Asian food, plenty of fruits and veggies and fresh fruit smoothies and juices so that you can stay focused and productive.</p>

		<h2>Learn Cool Stuff</h2>
		<p>As a technology agnostic event, there will be all kinds of hackers present - Ruby, PHP, C++, even some Erlang.  The best way to learn something new immersion, and as teams are formed to work on various ideas, you could find yourself with a new skill in just a couple of days.</p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h2>Make New Friends</h2>
		<p>Get to know people in the local technology that you may not know already.  Who knows - you could meet the pefect cofounder, employee or boss at this event.</p>
	</div><!--/span-->
	<div class="span4">
		<h2>Have Fun!</h2>
		<p>Not your typical listen to speakers and drink beer event.  The Nashville Hackathon is all about doing things yourself, building something special and cool with like-minded people.</p>
