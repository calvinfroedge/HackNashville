		<h2>Learn Cool Stuff</h2>
		<p>As a technology agnostic event, there will be all kinds of hackers present - Ruby, PHP, C++, even some Erlang.  The best way to learn something new immersion, and as teams are formed to work on various ideas, you could find yourself with a new skill in just a couple of days.</p>
