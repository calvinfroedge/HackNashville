With the help of FLO Thinkery they found the space (and internet) for Nashville's first coders only event. The idea was simple - come with a neglected side project, hang out with other hackers, grab some free food (from sponsors that probably want to hire you), and show-off progress when done. No rules.  No pitches. No suits!</p>
